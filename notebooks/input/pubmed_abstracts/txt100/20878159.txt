BACKGROUND: Both docetaxel-based and irinotecan-based chemotherapy has been
demonstrated as active combination regimen in either first-line or second-line
setting for metastatic gastric cancer. The purpose of this trial was to evaluate 
the two active regimens, docetaxel/cisplatin and FOLFIRI, as first- and
second-line chemotherapy and to compare the sequence of the two regimens in terms
of efficacy and tolerability.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to receive one of the two
treatment arms: Arm A-DP (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) D1, cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) D1
repeated every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxicity as the
first-line treatment which was followed by FOLFIRI (irinotecan 150 mg/m(2) D1,
leucovorin 100 mg/m(2) D1, 5-fluorouracil 3,000 mg/m(2) D1-2 for 48 h every
2 weeks) upon disease progression as second-line chemotherapy; Arm B-FOLFIRI as
the first-line treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity then 
followed by DP as the second-line treatment upon documented disease progression.
RESULTS: Between April 2005 and Aug 2008, 58 patients were enrolled (Arm A,
n = 28; Arm B, n = 30). Median follow-up was 38.2 months. The overall response
rate (ORR) of the first-line chemotherapy was 25.0% with DP (Arm A1) and 13.3
with FOLFIRI (Arm B1) (P = 0.322). The tumor control rate (TCR) of first-line
chemotherapy was 82.1% with DP and 66.7% with FOLFIRI (P = 0.209). The median
first progression-free survival (1st PFS) was 4.3 months with DP and 3.4 months
with FOLFIRI (P = 0.547). The overall response rate of second-line chemotherapy
was 20.0% with FOLFIRI (Arm A2) and 27.2% with DP (Arm B2) (P = 0.296). The tumor
control rate of second-line chemotherapy was 46.7% with FOLFIRI and 50.0% with
DP. The median second progression-free survival (2nd PFS) was 8.1 months with Arm
A and 6.7 months with Arm B (P = 0.865). The median overall survival was
12.5 months (95% CI 8.17-16.83) in Arm A and 13.4 months (95% CI 9.99-16.81) in
Arm B (P = 0.674). In safety profile, the incidence of neutropenic fever was
comparable among the 4 arms ranging from 0 to 3.9%.
CONCLUSIONS: The ORR, TCR of Arm A (DP ? FOLFIRI) were not different from those
of Arm B (FOLFIRI ? DP). There was no statistically significant difference in 1st
PFS, 2nd PFS, and OS of both arms. Although the trial was terminated early due to
poor patient accrual, we found that both DP and FOLFIRI regimens were tolerable
with comparable efficacies regardless of the sequence administered.
