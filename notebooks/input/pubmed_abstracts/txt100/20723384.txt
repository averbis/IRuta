BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of erlotinib as the first-line 
therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: A total of 28 pathologically-confirmed NSCLC patients who could not
receive willingly or tolerate traditional cytotoxic drugs chemotherapy were
enrolled. Erlotinib was orally administered 150 mg daily until disease
progression or the occurrence of intolerable toxicity.
RESULTS: Among a total of 28 patients, the objective response rate (ORR) of
erlotinib was 28.6%. The disease control rate (DCR) was 60.7%. The rate of
symptom relief was 53.6%. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 3.2
(95%CI: 0.851-5.585) months. The median overall survival (OS) was 9.6 (95%CI:
7.179-12.021) months. One-year survival rate was 32.1%. The therapeutic effect
was better in patients with rash. Most of the toxicities were grade I and grade
II toxicity. The most common adverse events were rash (46.4%), diarrhea (32.1%), 
skin dry (25.0%), anorexia(17.9%), fatigue (10.7%) and increased transaminase
(7.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Erlotinib provided another choice for the patients who could not
willingly receive or tolerate chemotherapy.
