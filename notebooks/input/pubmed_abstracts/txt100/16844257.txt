BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Platinum-based doublets are recommended as treatment for
advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, chemotherapy 
must be tailored to limit side effects. A phase II study was conducted to
evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin combined with docetaxel for
NSCLC.
METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB or IV, chemotherapy-naive NSCLC received
docetaxel 70 mg/m(2), oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2), and pegfilgrastim 6 mg every 21
days for up to six cycles. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR),
secondary endpoints were progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and
safety.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were treated; 93% had stage IV disease and 28% had 
brain metastases. In 27 evaluable patients with follow-up, there were 10 partial 
responses for an ORR of 37% (90% confidence interval [CI], 22-55%). Median PFS
was 4.6 months (95% CI, 2.6-6.5 months); 12-month PFS was 14.8% (95% CI,
3.4-34.0%). Median OS was 10.9 months (95% CI, 8.9-16.8 months); 12-month OS was 
40% (95% CI, 19-61%) and 18-month OS was 16% (95% CI, 1-46%). In 29 treated
patients, there were no unusual or unexpected adverse events. The most common
grade 3 and 4 toxicities were anemia (14% of patients) and hyperglycemia (10%);
there were only two reports of neutropenia; both were grade 1 or 2.
CONCLUSION: These phase II findings suggest that the combination of oxaliplatin
and docetaxel is active and well tolerated, and should be further investigated as
a feasible treatment alternative for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC.
