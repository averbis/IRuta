This phase II trial evaluated efficacy and safety of temozolomide (TMZ) in
combination with irinotecan (CPT-11) before radiotherapy in patients with newly
diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Prior to radiotherapy, patients were
treated with a maximum of three 6-week cycles of TMZ and CPT-11. Patients
received TMZ at a dose of 200 mg/m(2)/day on days 1-5 and CPT-11 on days 1, 8,
22, and 29, with a dose adjustment for enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug use.
The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end points
included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety, and
tumor O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) expression. Of the 42
patients treated, 8 (19%) patients achieved a partial response. Median PFS and
median OS were 3.1 and 13.8 months, respectively. Grade 3 or 4 AEs were
documented in 36% of patients, most of which were hematologic (29%). Twenty-four 
percent of patients had grade 3 or 4 non-hematologic AEs, with gastrointestinal
AEs being the most common (12%) Two patients died, one of intracranial hemorrhage
and one of treatment-related renal failure. Low MGMT expression, compared with
high MGMT expression, showed no significant difference in ORR (25 vs. 8%), median
PFS (14 vs. 5 months) or OS (21 vs. 15 months). Although TMZ plus CPT-11 is at
least comparable in efficacy to TMZ alone, this combination appears more toxic
and poorly tolerated. The lack of correlation of activity with MGMT expression is
intriguing, but needs further evaluation in subsequent trials.
