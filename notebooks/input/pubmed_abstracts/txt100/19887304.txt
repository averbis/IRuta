OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (PLD) and 
continuous infusion ifosfamide (IFO) in ovarian cancer patients who relapse
within 1 year after first-line paclitaxel-platinum-based chemotherapy.
METHODS: Patients were stratified according to treatment-free interval (TFI) (<or
>or=6 months). PLD (40 mg/m(2), day 1), IFO (1700 mg/m(2), infusion days 1-3),
and mesna were given every 28 days for 6-9 cycles. Primary endpoint was objective
response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were response duration, progression free
survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.
RESULTS: There were 98 evaluable patients (58%, TFI<6 months). Median number of
cycles was 5 (range: 1-9). The frequency of grade 3/4 anemia, thrombocytopenia,
and neutropenia was 7%, 3%, and 48%, respectively; febrile neutropenia was 3%. A 
low rate of grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicities was reported, including
nausea/vomiting (3/4%), hand-foot syndrome (2%), and mucositis (2%). The ORR was 
28% (41% and 19% in patients with TFI >or=6, or <6 months, respectively); rate of
disease stabilization was 26%; response duration and median OS were 6 (2.4-26)
and 14 (1-46) months, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The combination of PLD and continuous IFO is a feasible and efficient
treatment in patients with relapsed ovarian cancer, especially with TFI between 6
and 12 months. This regimen may represent an alternative to platinum
reintroduction and should be evaluated in a randomized trial.
