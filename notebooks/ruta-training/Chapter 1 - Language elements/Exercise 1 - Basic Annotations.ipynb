For each word, it is checked whether the condition `REGEXP(\"Dogs|cats\")` is satisfied. This condition is a regular expression that matches if the word is \"Dogs\" or \"cats\" (case sensitive). If the condition is satisfied, then the action is executed. In that case, the action is to create a new annotation of type `Animal`. You will see more complex conditions and actions in Exercise 4.\n",
