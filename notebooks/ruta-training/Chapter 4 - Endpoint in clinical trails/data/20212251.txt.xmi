We conducted a&#13;&#10;randomized phase III trial to compare efficacy and safety of cladribine and&#13;&#10;fludarabine, each combined with cyclophosphamide, in previously untreated&#13;&#10;progressive CLL. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients received cladribine at 0.12 mg/kg &#13;&#10;combined with cyclophosphamide at 250 mg/m(2) for 3 days intravenously (CC&#13;&#10;regimen) or fludarabine at 25 mg/m(2) combined with cyclophosphamide at 250&#13;&#10;mg/m(2) for 3 days intravenously (FC regimen), every 28 days for up to six&#13;&#10;cycles. The primary end point was complete response (CR) rate. Secondary end&#13;&#10;points included overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS),&#13;&#10;overall survival (OS), and treatment-related toxicity. RESULTS Of 423 randomly&#13;&#10;assigned patients (211 to CC and 212 to FC), 395 were evaluated in the final&#13;&#10;analysis. The CR and ORR reached 47% and 88% in the CC arm and 46% and 82% in the&#13;&#10;FC arm (P = .25 and P = .11, respectively). The median PFS was 2.34 years with CC&#13;&#10;and 2.27 years with FC (P = .51). OS and grade 3/4 treatment-related toxicity&#13;&#10;were also comparable. Moreover, we did not observe any significant differences in&#13;&#10;CC and FC efficacy across different patient prognostic subgroups that included&#13;&#10;patients with 17p13 (TP53 gene) deletion who had poor survival in both study&#13;&#10;arms. CONCLUSION Cladribine and fludarabine in combination with cyclophosphamide &#13;&#10;are equally effective and safe first-line regimens for progressive CLL. Both&#13;&#10;combinations have unsatisfactory activity in patients with 17p13 (TP53 gene)&#13;&#10;deletion."/>
