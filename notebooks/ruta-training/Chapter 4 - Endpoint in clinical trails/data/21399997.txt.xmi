Chinese female patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who&#13;&#10;failed at least one platinum-based chemotherapy received gefitinib monotherapy&#13;&#10;(250 mg/day) between April 2002 and January 2010. The primary endpoint was&#13;&#10;overall response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS)&#13;&#10;and progression-free survival (PFS). Of the 40 evaluable female patients, the ORR&#13;&#10;was 62.5%. All patients have responded with one (2.5%) complete response, 24&#13;&#10;(60%) partial response, 12 (30%) stable disease, and 3 (7.5%) progressive&#13;&#10;disease. The OS and PFS were 20 months (95% CI: 11.9-28 months) and 13 months&#13;&#10;(95% CI: 8.0-17.9 months), respectively. Survival (OS and PFS) were longer in&#13;&#10;patients with good performance status and in patients older than 65 years (P &lt;&#13;&#10;0.05). The most frequently observed toxicities were rash/dry skin (80%), diarrhea&#13;&#10;(42.5%), and vomiting/anorexia (32.5%). Four patients developed grade 3&#13;&#10;toxicities (rash and diarrhea) but did not require either dose reduction or&#13;&#10;discontinuation. Gefitinib is a highly effective and well-tolerated agent for&#13;&#10;Chinese women with pretreated advanced NSCLC."/>
