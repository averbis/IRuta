Liver-only disease (47% vs. 25%; P=0.0012) and absence of previous&#13;&#10;weight loss (38% vs. 20%; P=0.0189) were significantly associated with a higher&#13;&#10;ORR on the multivariate analysis. Absence of weight loss (hazard ratio, 1.40; 95%&#13;&#10;CI, 1.02-1.93; P=0.0377) was significantly associated with a longer PFS (7.5&#13;&#10;months vs. 6 months). Median OS was 15.1 months (95% CI, 13.5-16.6 months).&#13;&#10;Primary surgery, good performance status (PS), only one metastatic site, and&#13;&#10;oxaliplatin-based second-line treatment independently predicted a longer OS.&#13;&#10;Grade 4 neutropenia was significantly associated with a PS&gt;or=1, whereas risk of &#13;&#10;grade&gt;or=3 diarrhea was directly related to age and previous weight loss.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: Patients with no weight loss and/or preserved PS and with a limited&#13;&#10;disease extent appeared to obtain the greatest benefit from our&#13;&#10;irinotecan/5-FU/LV regimen, with acceptable toxicity. Notably, the regimen was&#13;&#10;effective and well tolerated by elderly patients. This regimen may represent the &#13;&#10;rationale for assessing the addition of novel antiangiogenic drugs to the&#13;&#10;treatment of metastatic CRC."/>
