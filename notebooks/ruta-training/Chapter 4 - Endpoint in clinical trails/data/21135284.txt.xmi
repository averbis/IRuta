The primary efficacy end point was overall response rate (ORR)&#13;&#10;for amrubicin. Secondary end points included time to progression, median&#13;&#10;progression-free survival (PFS), and median overall survival (OS).&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Of 76 patients enrolled, 50 patients were randomly assigned to&#13;&#10;amrubicin, and 26 patients were randomly assigned to topotecan. Amrubicin&#13;&#10;treatment resulted in a significantly higher ORR than topotecan (44% v 15%; P =&#13;&#10;.021). Median PFS and median OS were 4.5 months and 9.2 months with amrubicin and&#13;&#10;3.3 months and 7.6 months with topotecan, respectively. Tolerability was similar &#13;&#10;with both agents. However, grade 3 or worse neutropenia and thrombocytopenia&#13;&#10;seemed to be more frequent in the topotecan group as compared with the amrubicin &#13;&#10;group (78% and 61% v 61% and 39%, respectively).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: Amrubicin shows promising activity, with an ORR of 44% compared with &#13;&#10;an ORR of 15% for topotecan as second-line treatment in patients with SCLC&#13;&#10;sensitive to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. In addition, the safety&#13;&#10;profiles were comparable; however, a trend was noted for more frequent grade 3 or&#13;&#10;worse neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in the topotecan group as compared with&#13;&#10;the amrubicin group. Additional studies are ongoing."/>
