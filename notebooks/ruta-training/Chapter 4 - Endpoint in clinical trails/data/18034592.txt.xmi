    <cas:Sofa xmi:id="6" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="Cetuximab (Erbitux) is a human-mouse chimeric monoclonal antibody, which&#13;&#10;competitively binds to the accessible extracellular domain of the epidermal&#13;&#10;growth factor receptor (EGFR) to inhibit dimerisation and, subsequently, inhibit &#13;&#10;tumour growth and metastasis. In the EU and the US, cetuximab has been approved&#13;&#10;for use with concomitant radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced squamous &#13;&#10;cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and in combination with irinotecan&#13;&#10;for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in patients with&#13;&#10;EGFR-expressing tumours who are refractory to irinotecan-based therapy. In the&#13;&#10;US, cetuximab has also been approved as monotherapy in patients with recurrent or&#13;&#10;metastatic SCCHN for whom platinum-based therapy has failed and in patients with &#13;&#10;mCRC who are intolerant of irinotecan-based regimens.In treatment-naive patients &#13;&#10;with locoregionally advanced SCCHN, cetuximab plus radiotherapy was more&#13;&#10;effective than radiation therapy alone in prolonging locoregional disease&#13;&#10;control. In addition, more limited noncomparative data from a large trial&#13;&#10;indicated a 13% overall objective response rate (ORR) in platinum-refractory&#13;&#10;patients with SCCHN. In patients with EGFR-expressing mCRC, cetuximab plus&#13;&#10;irinotecan improved ORR more than cetuximab monotherapy in a trial in&#13;&#10;irinotecan-refractory patients; however, there was no difference in overall&#13;&#10;survival (OS) between cetuximab plus irinotecan and cetuximab monotherapy in&#13;&#10;oxaliplatin-refractory recipients in another trial. In an ongoing trial,&#13;&#10;progression-free survival (PFS) exceeded 50% after 12 weeks in&#13;&#10;irinotecan-refractory patients receiving three different dosages of cetuximab&#13;&#10;plus irinotecan. In another large trial, cetuximab monotherapy prolonged OS&#13;&#10;compared with best supportive care (BSC) in heavily pretreated patients. Overall,&#13;&#10;cetuximab treatment had an acceptable tolerability profile, with the majority of &#13;&#10;adverse events being mild or moderate in severity and clinically manageable. In&#13;&#10;particular, cetuximab therapy did not exacerbate toxicities commonly associated&#13;&#10;with chemo- or radiotherapeutic regimens. Albeit occurring with high incidence,&#13;&#10;adverse cutaneous reactions appear to be a marker for response. Results of&#13;&#10;ongoing head-to-head comparative trials comparing cetuximab with other biological&#13;&#10;agents will help to establish definitively the role of cetuximab in the&#13;&#10;management of SCCHN and mCRC. In the meantime, cetuximab, with its highly&#13;&#10;targeted mechanism of action and synergistic activity with current treatment&#13;&#10;modalities, is a valuable treatment option in patients with SCCHN and mCRC."/>
