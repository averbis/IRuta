All patients diagnosed with BM underwent local, BM-specific&#13;&#10;treatment before initiation of medical treatment.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Data of 114 consecutive patients who had access to at least one type of &#13;&#10;targeted agents were analyzed. Twelve out of 114 renal cell carcinoma (RCC)&#13;&#10;patients (10.5%) were diagnosed with BM. Systemic treatment consisted of&#13;&#10;sunitinib, sorafenib, temsirolimus or bevacizumab. The median PFS was 8.7 months &#13;&#10;(95% CI 5.1 - 12.3) and 11.4 months (95% CI 8.7 - 14.1) for BM-patients and&#13;&#10;non-BM-patients, respectively (p = 0.232). The median overall survival for&#13;&#10;patients with and without BM was 13.4 (95% CI 1- 43.9) and 33.3 months (95% CI&#13;&#10;18.6 - 47.0) (p = 0.358), respectively. No patient died from cerebral disease&#13;&#10;progression. ECOG Performance status and the time from primary tumor to&#13;&#10;metastases (TDM) were independent risk factors for short survival (HR 2.74, p =&#13;&#10;0.001; HR: 0.552, p = 0.034).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: Although extracerebral metastases determine the outcome of patients &#13;&#10;with BM, the benefit from targeted agents still appears to be limited when&#13;&#10;compared to patients without BM."/>
