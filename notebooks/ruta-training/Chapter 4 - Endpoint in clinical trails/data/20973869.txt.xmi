    <cas:Sofa xmi:id="6" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="We have recently reported favorable responses to a combination treatment&#13;&#10;comprising cimetidine, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor and a&#13;&#10;renin-angiotensin-system inhibitor in metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In&#13;&#10;view of the potential synergistic effects of these three agents and interferon-a &#13;&#10;(I-CCA therapy), we conducted a phase-II trial to examine the efficacy and&#13;&#10;toxicity of I-CCA as first-line treatment. Fifty-one patients with advanced RCC&#13;&#10;received natural interferon-a (3-6 million U thrice/week) and cimetidine (800&#13;&#10;mg), cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor meloxicam (10 mg), and renin-angiotensin-system&#13;&#10;inhibitor candesartan (4 mg) or perindopril (4 mg) orally daily. Memorial&#13;&#10;Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prognostic categories were favorable, intermediate &#13;&#10;and poor in 10 (20%), 31 (61%) and 10 (20%) patients, respectively. The primary&#13;&#10;end-point was the objective response rate (ORR) and the secondary end-points&#13;&#10;included clinical benefit, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS)&#13;&#10;and safety. Median follow-up was 19 months. Complete response (CR) was observed&#13;&#10;in four patients (8%) and partial response in seven (14%), yielding an ORR of&#13;&#10;22%. None of the four patients who achieved CR relapsed during the 16- to&#13;&#10;81-month follow up. The ORR were 17% in the favorable- or intermediate-risk group&#13;&#10;and 40% in the poor-risk group. The other 24 patients (45%) had stable disease&#13;&#10;for at least 6 months, resulting in a clinical benefit rate of 67%. The median&#13;&#10;PFS and OS were 12 and 30 months, respectively. Grade 3/4 toxicities were never&#13;&#10;observed. The I-CCA therapy, providing favorable responses and low toxicity&#13;&#10;profiles, is worthy of further consideration as a first-line therapy for&#13;&#10;metastatic RCC."/>
