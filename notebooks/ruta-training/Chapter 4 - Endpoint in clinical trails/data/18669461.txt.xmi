The primary end point was objective&#13;&#10;response rate (ORR). Secondary end points included progression-free survival&#13;&#10;(PFS), duration of response (DR), overall survival (OS), and safety. Plasma&#13;&#10;soluble proteins (vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]-A, VEGF-C, soluble&#13;&#10;VEGF receptor [sVEGFR]-3, and placental growth factor [PlGF]) levels were&#13;&#10;measured.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were enrolled. The ORR was 23.0% (95% CI, 13.2% to&#13;&#10;35.5%), median PFS was 30.4 weeks (95% CI, 18.3 to 36.7 weeks), median DR was&#13;&#10;44.1 weeks (95% CI, 25.0 to 102.7 weeks), and median OS was 47.1 weeks (95% CI,&#13;&#10;36.9 to 79.4 weeks). Mean plasma VEGF-A and PlGF levels significantly increased&#13;&#10;whereas VEGF-C and sVEGFR-3 levels decreased with sunitinib treatment. Lower&#13;&#10;baseline levels of sVEGFR-3 and VEGF-C were associated with longer PFS and ORR.&#13;&#10;Most treatment-related adverse events were of mild-to-moderate intensity and&#13;&#10;included fatigue, hypertension, and hand-foot syndrome.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: Sunitinib has substantial antitumor activity in patients with&#13;&#10;bevacizumab-refractory mRCC and modulates circulating VEGF pathway biomarkers.&#13;&#10;These data support the hypothesis that sunitinib inhibits signaling pathways&#13;&#10;involved in bevacizumab resistance. Baseline levels of sVEGFR-3 and VEGF-C may&#13;&#10;have potential utility as biomarkers of clinical efficacy in this setting."/>
