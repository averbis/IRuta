    <cas:Sofa xmi:id="6" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="The life-expectancy of women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is closely&#13;&#10;linked to response to therapy. A significant increase in progression-free&#13;&#10;survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) has been demonstrated in women who&#13;&#10;achieve a complete response. Anthracycline combinations have been proven as&#13;&#10;highly effective in MBC, and anthracycline regimens plus cyclophosphamide with or&#13;&#10;without fluorouracil were established as first-line chemotherapy for MBC in the&#13;&#10;1990s. Clinical trials have shown that anthracycline-taxane combinations are more&#13;&#10;effective than anthracyclines or taxanes alone in terms of overall response rates&#13;&#10;(ORR), PFS and OS in women who have not received prior anthracycline&#13;&#10;chemotherapy. The use of anthracycline-based regimens is limited, however, by the&#13;&#10;widespread use of anthracycline adjuvant therapy and the development of&#13;&#10;anthracycline-resistance. Platinum-taxane combinations have similar efficacy to&#13;&#10;anthracycline-based regimens and are well-tolerated by patients. Carboplatin&#13;&#10;combined with paclitaxel or docetaxel is more effective than carboplatin or&#13;&#10;taxanes alone, with ORR of 53-62%. Taxane combinations with gemcitabine or&#13;&#10;capecitabine are also more effective than docetaxel, paclitaxel, capecitabine or &#13;&#10;gemcitabine administered alone. The efficacy of docetaxel and paclitaxel can be&#13;&#10;increased, and drug-related toxicity decreased, by adapting dose-dense schedules &#13;&#10;of drug administration. The addition of trastuzumab to taxane-based chemotherapy &#13;&#10;increases the efficacy of taxane-based regimens in women with HER2-positive MBC."/>
