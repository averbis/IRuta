Tasisulam demonstrated activity across a broad&#13;&#10;range of tumors, including melanoma. The primary objective of this phase 2 study &#13;&#10;was to determine the objective response rate (ORR) in patients who had received 1&#13;&#10;previous systemic chemotherapy for unresectable/metastatic melanoma; secondary&#13;&#10;objectives were to evaluate the clinical response rate (CRR), progression-free&#13;&#10;survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response, safety, and&#13;&#10;pharmacokinetics.&#13;&#10;METHODS: Tasisulam was administered intravenously on Day 1 of 21-day cycles&#13;&#10;according to a lean body weight-based dosing algorithm targeting a peak plasma&#13;&#10;concentration (C(max)) of 420 µg/mL.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: In 68 enrolled patients, the median age was 59 years (range, 26-83&#13;&#10;years). No patients had a complete response (CR), 8 patients had a partial&#13;&#10;response (PR), and 24 patients had stable disease (SD); the ORR (CR + PR) was&#13;&#10;11.8%, and the CRR (CR + PR + SD) was 47.1%. The median PFS was 2.6 months, and&#13;&#10;the median OS was 9.6 months. The predominant treatment-related grade 3/4&#13;&#10;toxicity was thrombocytopenia (20.6% of patients). Tasisulam exhibited a&#13;&#10;biexponential disposition with a predicted distribution half-life of 0.3 hours to&#13;&#10;2.8 hours and a median terminal elimination half-life of 10 days (consistent with&#13;&#10;the turnover of albumin), suggesting that tasisulam is very tightly bound to&#13;&#10;albumin.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: Tasisulam administered at a targeted C(max) of 420 µg/mL on Day 1 of&#13;&#10;21-day cycles demonstrated activity and tolerable toxicity as second-line&#13;&#10;treatment in malignant melanoma. These results led to a registration trial in&#13;&#10;metastatic melanoma."/>
