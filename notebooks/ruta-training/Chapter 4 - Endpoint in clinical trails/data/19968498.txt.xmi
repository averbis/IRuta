Patients&#13;&#10;with APC, ECOG performance status &lt; or = 2, no prior chemotherapy and adequate&#13;&#10;organ function were treated with 3-hour GPM infusions every 3 weeks. Initial&#13;&#10;patients were treated with 435 mg/m(2) (n = 11). The dose was reduced for&#13;&#10;subsequent patients to 350 or 300 mg/m(2) (n = 45). Primary endpoint was time to &#13;&#10;tumor progression (TTP).&#13;&#10;RESULTS: 56 patients were enrolled. Median TTP for patients treated with 300 or&#13;&#10;350 mg/m(2) doses was 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.6-4.2). Median progression free&#13;&#10;survival (PFS) was 2.8 months (95% CI, 1.4-4.0). Median overall survival (OS) was&#13;&#10;6.5 months (95% CI, 5.1-7.9). Among patients treated with above doses of GPM,&#13;&#10;there was 1 complete remission (CR) and 2 partial remissions (PR) with an overall&#13;&#10;response rate (ORR) of 6.7%. Disease control rate (CR + PR + stable disease) was &#13;&#10;60.0%. Most common grade 3 toxicities were: neutropenia (40.0%), fatigue (17.8%),&#13;&#10;infection, dehydration, neuropathy (each 13.3%), and abdominal pain (11.1%).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of APC with GPM at a dose of 300 mg/m(2) q 3 weeks was&#13;&#10;well tolerated and common toxicities were qualitatively similar to&#13;&#10;Cremophor-based paclitaxel. GPM monotherapy resulted in OS and other efficacy&#13;&#10;parameters preferable to that seen historically with gemcitabine. Future studies &#13;&#10;of GPM in combination with other agents for treatment of APC are warranted."/>
