    <cas:Sofa xmi:id="6" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="This study was designed to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of&#13;&#10;first-line gefitinib treatment in patients with advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma&#13;&#10;harboring epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and to explore the&#13;&#10;molecular factors affecting the efficacy of gefitinib. Tumor tissue, derived from&#13;&#10;either the original tumor or the metastatic or recurrent site was taken from&#13;&#10;chemo-naÃ¯ve pts with advanced (stage IIIB, IV, and recurrent) pulmonary&#13;&#10;adenocarcinoma. Tumor genomic DNA underwent direct sequencing for EGFR exons 18, &#13;&#10;19, 20, and 21. Patients with EGFR mutations received 250 mg of gefitinib daily&#13;&#10;until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was&#13;&#10;objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were progression free survival&#13;&#10;(PFS), overall survival (OS) and tolerability. Out of 147 screened patients, 45&#13;&#10;pts (31%) had EGFR mutations and received gefitinib. The most common EGFR&#13;&#10;mutations were in-frame exon 19 deletions (29 pts, 64%) and L858R point mutation &#13;&#10;in exon 21 (15 pts, 33%). One patient had atypical mutation of L861Q in exon 21. &#13;&#10;The ORR was 53.3% (95% CI, 38.6-67.9) and disease control rate (DCR) including&#13;&#10;stable disease was 86.7%. The median progression free survival (PFS) was 398 days&#13;&#10;and the median overall survival (OS) was 819 days. Treatment was well tolerated. &#13;&#10;Grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were reported by 6 patients and treatment-related &#13;&#10;Grade 3 AEs by 3 patients. There were no treatment-related Grade 4 AEs.&#13;&#10;Exploratory subgroup analysis according to the EGFR mutation subtypes was carried&#13;&#10;out. The ORR and DCR were higher in patients with exon 19 deletions than those&#13;&#10;with L858R (62.1% vs 33.3%; P=0.0705 and 96.6% vs 66.7%; P=0.0062, respectively).&#13;&#10;All 4 patients with progressive disease had a L858R mutation. No secondary&#13;&#10;resistant mutations such as T790M mutation or insertions in exon 20 were found in&#13;&#10;those patients. In addition, OS was significantly better in patients with exon 19&#13;&#10;deletions than those with L858R (24-month OS rate was 72.1% vs 32.0%, P=0.0148). &#13;&#10;Gefitinib as the first-line treatment for Korean patients with advanced pulmonary&#13;&#10;adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutations was effective and well tolerated.&#13;&#10;Subgroup analysis suggests that the benefit from gefitinib treatment was more&#13;&#10;prominent in patients with the exon 19 deletion mutations (ClinicalTrials.gov&#13;&#10;number, NCT00344773)."/>
