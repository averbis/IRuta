Pemetrexed, an antifolate,&#13;&#10;inhibits several folate-dependent enzymes involved in purine biosynthesis. The&#13;&#10;primary goal of this study was to determine the objective response rate in&#13;&#10;patients with advanced or MBC given pemetrexed as a first-line, dose-dense, every&#13;&#10;2-week chemotherapy. Women with HER2-negative advanced or MBC, without prior&#13;&#10;cytotoxic treatment for this stage of disease, were treated with intravenous&#13;&#10;pemetrexed 600 mg/mÂ² on Day 1 of each 14-day cycle. Standard dexamethasone, folic&#13;&#10;acid, and vitamin B(12) premedications were given. 37 patients enrolled; 36&#13;&#10;received = 1 dose of pemetrexed and 35 were evaluable for response. Median age of&#13;&#10;patients was 61.4 years, 76% were hormone receptor positive (ER+ and/or PR+).&#13;&#10;Prior treatment included adjuvant chemotherapy (57%) and/or endocrine (65%).&#13;&#10;Patients received a median of 6 cycles of pemetrexed (range, 1-21). Based on 35&#13;&#10;evaluable patients, the overall response rate (ORR) was 26% (1 CR and 8 PR), and &#13;&#10;the clinical benefit rate (CR+ PR+ stable disease [SD] = 6 months) was 40%.&#13;&#10;Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4.1 months (range, &lt;1-22.4). Median&#13;&#10;overall survival (OS) was 18.9 months (range, &lt;1-27.7). Grades 3-4&#13;&#10;treatment-related toxicities included: neutropenia (36%), leukopenia (17%),&#13;&#10;fatigue (14%), and anemia (14%). Grade 1/2 alopecia was seen in 8% of patients.&#13;&#10;This phase II study of dose-dense, single-agent pemetrexed showed moderate&#13;&#10;activity in the first-line setting with acceptable toxicity and no significant&#13;&#10;alopecia."/>
