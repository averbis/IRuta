In the present randomized phase II study,&#13;&#10;we examined the efficacy and safety of a Lipoplatin-gemcitabine versus a&#13;&#10;cisplatin-gemcitabine combination as first line treatment in advanced NSCLC.&#13;&#10;PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with advanced (stages IIIB-IV) NSCLC received up&#13;&#10;to six 21-day cycles of Lipoplatin 120 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, 15) and gemcitabine&#13;&#10;1000 mg/m(2) (days 1+8) (arm A; LipoGem) versus cisplatin 100mg/m(2) (day 1) and &#13;&#10;gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) (days 1+8) (arm B; CisGem). The primary objective was&#13;&#10;objective response rate (ORR). Secondary objectives were disease control rate&#13;&#10;(DCR), progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response and overall survival&#13;&#10;(OS). Another secondary objective was safety and tolerability of the LipoGem&#13;&#10;combination.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Eighty-eight patients (n=88) entered the study; 47 patients were treated&#13;&#10;with LipoGem versus 41 patients treated with CisGem. Efficacy was assessed in&#13;&#10;patients who completed at least 1 cycle of treatment; ORR was 31.7% in arm A&#13;&#10;versus 25.6% in arm B and DCR was 70.7% versus 56.4%, respectively. A preliminary&#13;&#10;efficacy of LipoGem versus CisGem in the adenocarcinoma histological subtype of&#13;&#10;NSCLC showed 16.7% versus 45.8% PD. Treatment in arm A was better tolerated with &#13;&#10;myelotoxicity and a transient mild elevation of serum creatinine as the dominant &#13;&#10;side effects; the only grade 4 adverse event was neutropenia noted in 2% of the&#13;&#10;patients. There was a significant reduction in nephrotoxicity in the LipoGem arm &#13;&#10;(0% versus 5% grade III, p-value&lt;0.001) as well as in nausea vomiting (2% versus &#13;&#10;12% grade III, p-value&lt;0.001). In addition, less antiemetics and G-CSF were&#13;&#10;administered in arm A.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: Overall, Lipoplatin appears to have lower toxicity, mainly renal&#13;&#10;toxicity as well as higher efficacy than cisplatin when combined with gemcitabine&#13;&#10;in advanced NSCLC."/>
