Sixty-two women who had received at&#13;&#10;least 3 above-mentioned drug classes were treated with oxaliplatin 85 mg/m(2) as &#13;&#10;a 2-h infusion on day 1, LV 200 mg/m(2) as a 2-h infusion followed by bolus 5-FU &#13;&#10;400 mg/m(2) on day 1, and a continuous infusion of 5-FU 1,200 mg/m(2) for 44 h.&#13;&#10;The median patient age was 52 years with a median of two involved organs, and the&#13;&#10;metastases were mostly in the lung (53.2%), lymph nodes (51.6%), and liver&#13;&#10;(45.2%). Patients had a median of three prior chemotherapy regimens. Forty-five&#13;&#10;patients (72.6%) had prior exposure to all 5 classes of drugs. Based on an&#13;&#10;intention-to-treat analysis, 60 patients were assessable for responses and 11&#13;&#10;patients achieved a partial response (PR), giving an overall response rate (ORR) &#13;&#10;of 18.3%. Twenty-one (35%) patients had stable disease (SD), and of these, 8&#13;&#10;achieved long SD (13.3%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3&#13;&#10;months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 10 months. Toxicity was mild to &#13;&#10;moderate with grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and neuropathy&#13;&#10;occurring in 14 (22.6%), 9 (14.5%), and 3 (4.8%) patients, respectively. The&#13;&#10;study demonstrated that the combination of oxaliplatin plus 5-FU/LV was a&#13;&#10;well-tolerated salvage regimen with moderate activity in patients with heavily&#13;&#10;pretreated MBC."/>
