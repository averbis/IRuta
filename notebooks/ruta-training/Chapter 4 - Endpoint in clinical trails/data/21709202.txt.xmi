Primary end point was overall survival (OS);&#13;&#10;secondary end points included overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free&#13;&#10;survival (PFS).&#13;&#10;RESULTS: One thousand two hundred ninety-nine patients were randomly assigned.&#13;&#10;The trial was stopped for futility at interim analysis. At final analysis, there &#13;&#10;was no difference in OS seen between ASA404 (n = 649) and placebo (n = 650) arms:&#13;&#10;median OS was 13.4 and 12.7 months respectively (hazard ratio [HR], 1.01; 95% CI,&#13;&#10;0.85 to 1.19; P = .535). Similarly, no OS difference was seen in the histologic&#13;&#10;(squamous or nonsquamous) and sex (male or female) strata. Median PFS was 5.5&#13;&#10;months in both arms (HR, 1.04; P = .727), while ORR was 25% in both arms (P =&#13;&#10;1.0). Overall rate of adverse events (AEs) was comparable between the ASA404 and &#13;&#10;placebo arms. Grade 4 neutropenia (27% v 19%) and infusion site pain (10% v 0.5%)&#13;&#10;were reported more frequently in the ASA404 arm.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: The addition of ASA404 to carboplatin and paclitaxel, although&#13;&#10;generally well tolerated, failed to improve frontline efficacy in advanced NSCLC."/>
