We examined the&#13;&#10;efficacy and safety of adding gemcitabine to paclitaxel/bevacizumab (PB).&#13;&#10;PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this multicenter, open-label, randomized phase II trial,&#13;&#10;women with locally advanced or MBC were randomly assigned to receive paclitaxel&#13;&#10;90 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, 15) and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg (days 1, 15) with or without &#13;&#10;gemcitabine 1500 mg/m(2) (days 1, 15) in 28-day cycles. Patients with prior&#13;&#10;cytotoxic therapy for MBC were ineligible. The primary endpoint was&#13;&#10;investigator-assessed overall response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints were PFS, &#13;&#10;overall survival (OS), safety, and quality of life.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Ninety-four patients received PB, and 93 received&#13;&#10;paclitaxel/bevacizumab/gemcitabine (PB+G). The ORRs were 48.9% (95% confidence&#13;&#10;interval [CI], 38.5%-59.5%) and 58.7% (95% CI, 47.9%-68.9%; P = .117) with PB and&#13;&#10;PB+G, respectively. The median PFS was 8.8 months (95% CI, 8.1-10.4 months) and&#13;&#10;11.3 months (95% CI, 9.7-12.7 months; P = .247; hazard ratio, 0.82); the median&#13;&#10;OS was 25.0 months (95% CI, 18.8-not assessable [N/A] months) and 24.3 months&#13;&#10;(95% CI, 20.3-N/A months; P = .475; hazard ratio, 0.84), with PB and PB+G,&#13;&#10;respectively. There was significantly more grade 3-4 neutropenia (P = .001) and&#13;&#10;dyspnea (P = .014) with PB+G. Patients treated with PB experienced more&#13;&#10;improvement in total FACT-B (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast) (P =&#13;&#10;.021), FACT-B Social/Family Well-being (P = .041), and Breast Cancer-Additional&#13;&#10;Concerns (P = .008) scores than patients treated with PB+G.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: The addition of gemcitabine to PB was not associated with a&#13;&#10;statistically significant improvement in ORR. Treatment with PB+G increased the&#13;&#10;incidence of severe neutropenia and dyspnea, although the regimen generally was&#13;&#10;well tolerated."/>
