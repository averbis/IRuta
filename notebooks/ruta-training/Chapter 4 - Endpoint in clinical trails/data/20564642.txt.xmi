BTD induction&#13;&#10;comprised up to 8 3-week cycles of bortezomib 1.3 mg/m(2) on Days 1, 4, 8, and&#13;&#10;11; thalidomide 100 mg daily; and dexamethasone 40 mg on Days 1 through 4 and&#13;&#10;Days 9 through 12. Stem cell mobilization involved granulocyte-colony-stimulating&#13;&#10;factor and/or cyclophosphamide. Response was assessed according to European Group&#13;&#10;for Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Review of medical records identified 44 eligible patients (34 patients&#13;&#10;who were treated in the front-line setting and 10 patients who were treated for&#13;&#10;recurrent disease) who received a median of 4 BTD cycles. The overall response&#13;&#10;rate (ORR) was 91%, which included a greater than or equal to very good partial&#13;&#10;response (&gt; or = VGPR) rate of 57% (including 20% stringent complete&#13;&#10;responses/complete response [sCR/CR] rate). In front-line patients, the ORR was&#13;&#10;94%, which included a 56% &gt; or = VGPR rate (24% sCR/CR). The median CD34-positive&#13;&#10;stem cell collection was 10.67 x 10(6)/kg. The ORR after ASCT in 34 patients who &#13;&#10;were evaluable for response was 100%, including a 76% &gt; or = VGPR rate (53%&#13;&#10;sCR/CR). Among all 44 patients, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was&#13;&#10;27.4 months. The median overall survival (OS) was not reached after a median&#13;&#10;follow-up of 25 months, and the 2-year OS rate was 82%. There were no significant&#13;&#10;differences in PFS (27.4 months vs 23.5 months) or in 2-year survival (80% vs&#13;&#10;90%) between patients who did and did not undergo ASCT, respectively. Twenty&#13;&#10;patients (45%) developed neuropathy, including 4 (9%) with grade 3 neuropathy&#13;&#10;episodes, and 1 patient developed deep vein thrombosis.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: BTD was highly effective and well tolerated as induction for MM&#13;&#10;patients who were eligible for ASCT. Long-term outcomes appeared to be similar&#13;&#10;with or without ASCT consolidation."/>
