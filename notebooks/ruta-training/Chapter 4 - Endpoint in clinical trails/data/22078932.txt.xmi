The primary end-point was objective response rate (ORR) per&#13;&#10;response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) by central imaging.&#13;&#10;Secondary end-points were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) &#13;&#10;and time to progression (TTP). Safety was also assessed.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Fifty-three patients, median age 61 years (range 40-80) were enrolled&#13;&#10;(August 2007 to October 2008) across 12 North-American centres. Median number of &#13;&#10;prior therapies was 2 (range 1-4); 43 patients (81%) had clear-cell histology.&#13;&#10;ORR was 13.2%, median PFS was 5.4 months (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 3.6, 6.0)&#13;&#10;and TTP was the same; median OS was 14.5 months (95% CI: 10.8, 24.1). The most&#13;&#10;common treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were diarrhoea (74%), fatigue (74%)&#13;&#10;and hypertension (66%), and the most common treatment-related Grade 3/4 AE was&#13;&#10;hypertension (40%).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: Linifanib demonstrated clinically meaningful activity in patients&#13;&#10;with advanced RCC after sunitinib failure. At 0.25 mg/kg/day, significant dose&#13;&#10;modifications were required. An alternative, fixed-dosing strategy is being&#13;&#10;evaluated in other trials."/>
