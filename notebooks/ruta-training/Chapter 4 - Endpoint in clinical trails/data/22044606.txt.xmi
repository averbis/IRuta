Pemetrexed in combination with carboplatin has been shown &#13;&#10;to be feasible in a phase I study in PSOC. The primary objective of this&#13;&#10;subsequent phase II study was to determine the overall response rate (ORR;&#13;&#10;defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) of this combination in&#13;&#10;patients with recurrent PSOC. Secondary objectives included progression-free&#13;&#10;survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity.&#13;&#10;METHODS: Patients with PSOC (defined by recurrence = 6 months after completion of&#13;&#10;up to two lines of prior platinum-based therapy), measurable disease, Eastern&#13;&#10;Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2, and adequate organ&#13;&#10;function were eligible. Pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) was administered as a 10-minute&#13;&#10;infusion followed by carboplatin AUC 6 as a 30-minute infusion on day 1 of a&#13;&#10;21-day cycle.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Sixty-six patients were treated. Of the 61 patients evaluable for&#13;&#10;response, there were 20 responders (one complete response and 19 partial&#13;&#10;responses), for an ORR of 32.8% (95% CI: 21.3%, 46.0%). For the intent-to-treat&#13;&#10;population (all 66 patients), the median PFS was 9.4 months (95% CI: 8.3, 11.1), &#13;&#10;with 22.7% censoring. Median OS was not reached due to the high censoring rate.&#13;&#10;There was one drug-related death (multi-organ failure). The most common&#13;&#10;drug-related grade 3/4 toxicities were neutropenia (39.4%), thrombocytopenia&#13;&#10;(24.2%), carboplatin hypersensitivity (9.1%), nausea (6.1%), and vomiting (6.1%).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: Carboplatin AUC 6 and pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) has a low incidence of &#13;&#10;serious toxicities. Defining the platinum-based combination with the best&#13;&#10;therapeutic index would require a prospective phase III study."/>
