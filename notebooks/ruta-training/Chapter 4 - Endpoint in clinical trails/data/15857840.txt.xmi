The purpose of this study was to investigate&#13;&#10;specifically the efficacy of fluorouracil-based first-line chemotherapy in&#13;&#10;patients with advanced mucinous CRC.&#13;&#10;PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients with advanced mucinous CRC enrolled in three&#13;&#10;prospective randomized trials evaluating infused 5-fluorouracil as first-line&#13;&#10;treatment were compared with patients with non-mucinous subtypes enrolled in the &#13;&#10;same trials in a case-control study. Prognostic factors associated with overall&#13;&#10;response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS)&#13;&#10;were identified using univariate and multivariate logistic and/or Cox&#13;&#10;proportional hazards analyses.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: The study included 135 patients (45 cases and 90 controls). The response&#13;&#10;rates for cases and controls were 22% [95% confidence interval (CI), 11% to 38%] &#13;&#10;and 47% (95% CI, 36.1% to 58.2%), respectively (P=0.0058). Median OS for the&#13;&#10;mucinous CRC patients was 11.8 months (95% CI, 8.87-14.8) compared with 17.9&#13;&#10;months (95% CI, 13.38-22.39) in the control group (univariate analysis, P=0.056);&#13;&#10;after correcting for significant prognostic factors by multivariate Cox&#13;&#10;regression analysis, P=0.0372 and hazard ratio (HR)=1.497 (1.02-2.19).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: Patients with advanced mucinous CRC have a poorer response to&#13;&#10;fluorouracil-based first-line chemotherapy and reduced survival compared with&#13;&#10;patients with non-mucinous CRC."/>
