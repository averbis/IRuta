This phase III study&#13;&#10;compared the efficacy and safety of gemcitabine-docetaxel (GD) with&#13;&#10;capecitabine-docetaxel (CD) in advanced breast cancer.&#13;&#10;PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to GD (G 1,000 mg/m(2) days&#13;&#10;1 and 8; D 75 mg/m(2) day 1) or CD (C 1,250 mg/m(2) twice daily days 1 through&#13;&#10;14; D 75 mg/m(2) day 1) every 21 days. Comparison of progression-free survival&#13;&#10;(PFS) was the primary objective.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Patient characteristics were balanced between arms (N = 305). Median PFS&#13;&#10;was 8.05 months (95% CI, 6.60 to 8.71) for GD and 7.98 (95% CI, 6.93 to 8.77) for&#13;&#10;CD (log-rank P = .121). Overall response rate (ORR) was 32% in both arms, and&#13;&#10;overall survival (OS) was not different between arms (P = .983). Time to&#13;&#10;treatment failure (TTF; defined as discontinuation, progressive disease, death as&#13;&#10;a result of any cause, or the start of a new anticancer therapy) was superior in &#13;&#10;the GD arm (P = .059). Hematologic toxicity was similar in both arms, except for &#13;&#10;grades 3 to 4 leukopenia (GD, 78%; CD, 66%; P = .025) and transfusions (GD, 17%; &#13;&#10;CD, 7%; P = .0051). Grades 3 to 4 diarrhea, mucositis, and hand-and-foot syndrome&#13;&#10;were significantly higher in the CD arm. Fewer patients in the GD arm&#13;&#10;discontinued because of drug-related adverse events (13% v 27% in CD; P = .002).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: No difference was observed between GD and CD arms in PFS, ORR, and&#13;&#10;OS. TTF was longer in the GD arm. These findings, combined with a nonhematologic &#13;&#10;toxicity profile that favors GD over approved doses of CD, suggest that&#13;&#10;gemcitabine may be a better option than capecitabine in combination with&#13;&#10;docetaxel in this clinical setting."/>
