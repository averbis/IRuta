This Phase 2 study &#13;&#10;evaluated efficacy, pharmacokinetics and safety of panitumumab in Japanese&#13;&#10;patients with mCRC who developed progressive disease during or after&#13;&#10;fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan and oxaliplatin chemotherapy.&#13;&#10;METHODS: Eligible patients had histologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma&#13;&#10;and EGFR tumor expression in &gt; or =1% of tumor cells by immunohistochemistry.&#13;&#10;Patients received panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or &#13;&#10;unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) per&#13;&#10;modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) by independent&#13;&#10;central review. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS),&#13;&#10;overall survival (OS), pharmacokinetic parameters and incidence of adverse&#13;&#10;events.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Fifty-two patients received at least one dose of panitumumab. Seven&#13;&#10;patients had partial responses for a confirmed ORR of 13.5% (95% CI: 5.6, 25.8). &#13;&#10;Median PFS was 8.0 weeks (95% CI: 7.4, 11.4) and median OS was 9.3 months (95%&#13;&#10;CI: 7.1, 12.8). Panitumumab pharmacokinetics were consistent with prior studies&#13;&#10;in Japanese and non-Japanese patients. The most common treatment-related adverse &#13;&#10;events (all, worst grade 3) were acne (81%, 2%), dry skin (62%, 0%), rash (46%,&#13;&#10;2%), paronychia (33%, 2%), pruritus (33%, 0%) and hypomagnesemia (33%, 0%). No&#13;&#10;adverse event of infusion reaction was reported by the investigators.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: Panitumumab monotherapy was active in Japanese patients with&#13;&#10;chemotherapy-refractory mCRC, with pharmacokinetic and safety profiles similar to&#13;&#10;those seen in prior studies."/>
