The purpose of this trial was to evaluate &#13;&#10;the two active regimens, docetaxel/cisplatin and FOLFIRI, as first- and&#13;&#10;second-line chemotherapy and to compare the sequence of the two regimens in terms&#13;&#10;of efficacy and tolerability.&#13;&#10;PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to receive one of the two&#13;&#10;treatment arms: Arm A-DP (docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) D1, cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) D1&#13;&#10;repeated every 3 weeks) until progression or unacceptable toxicity as the&#13;&#10;first-line treatment which was followed by FOLFIRI (irinotecan 150 mg/m(2) D1,&#13;&#10;leucovorin 100 mg/m(2) D1, 5-fluorouracil 3,000 mg/m(2) D1-2 for 48 h every&#13;&#10;2 weeks) upon disease progression as second-line chemotherapy; Arm B-FOLFIRI as&#13;&#10;the first-line treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity then &#13;&#10;followed by DP as the second-line treatment upon documented disease progression.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Between April 2005 and Aug 2008, 58 patients were enrolled (Arm A,&#13;&#10;n = 28; Arm B, n = 30). Median follow-up was 38.2 months. The overall response&#13;&#10;rate (ORR) of the first-line chemotherapy was 25.0% with DP (Arm A1) and 13.3&#13;&#10;with FOLFIRI (Arm B1) (P = 0.322). The tumor control rate (TCR) of first-line&#13;&#10;chemotherapy was 82.1% with DP and 66.7% with FOLFIRI (P = 0.209). The median&#13;&#10;first progression-free survival (1st PFS) was 4.3 months with DP and 3.4 months&#13;&#10;with FOLFIRI (P = 0.547). The overall response rate of second-line chemotherapy&#13;&#10;was 20.0% with FOLFIRI (Arm A2) and 27.2% with DP (Arm B2) (P = 0.296). The tumor&#13;&#10;control rate of second-line chemotherapy was 46.7% with FOLFIRI and 50.0% with&#13;&#10;DP. The median second progression-free survival (2nd PFS) was 8.1 months with Arm&#13;&#10;A and 6.7 months with Arm B (P = 0.865). The median overall survival was&#13;&#10;12.5 months (95% CI 8.17-16.83) in Arm A and 13.4 months (95% CI 9.99-16.81) in&#13;&#10;Arm B (P = 0.674). In safety profile, the incidence of neutropenic fever was&#13;&#10;comparable among the 4 arms ranging from 0 to 3.9%.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: The ORR, TCR of Arm A (DP ? FOLFIRI) were not different from those&#13;&#10;of Arm B (FOLFIRI ? DP). There was no statistically significant difference in 1st&#13;&#10;PFS, 2nd PFS, and OS of both arms. Although the trial was terminated early due to&#13;&#10;poor patient accrual, we found that both DP and FOLFIRI regimens were tolerable&#13;&#10;with comparable efficacies regardless of the sequence administered."/>
