Bevacizumab, a potent angiogenesis inhibitor, has also been shown&#13;&#10;to have activity in patients with EOC. Therefore, we sought to determine if the&#13;&#10;addition of bevacizumab to weekly paclitaxel led to an increased survival&#13;&#10;compared to weekly paclitaxel alone.&#13;&#10;METHODS: A single institutional review was conducted for patients with recurrent &#13;&#10;EOC treated with weekly paclitaxel (60-70mg/m(2)) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of a&#13;&#10;28day cycle and those treated with weekly paclitaxel and bevacizumab (10-15mg/kg &#13;&#10;on day 1 and 15). Response rates (RR) were calculated, and progression-free&#13;&#10;survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared using Kaplan-Meier&#13;&#10;survival analysis.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients treated with weekly paclitaxel and 41 patients&#13;&#10;treated with paclitaxel/bevacizumab were identified. The groups were similar in&#13;&#10;demographics, initial optimal cytoreduction, stage, histology, grade, platinum&#13;&#10;sensitivity, and median number of previous regimens (4 vs. 4, p=0.69).The overall&#13;&#10;response rate (ORR) was 63% (complete response (CR) 34% and partial response (PR)&#13;&#10;29%) for paclitaxel/bevacizumab and 48% (CR 17% and PR 31%) for weekly paclitaxel&#13;&#10;(p=0.23). Improvement in PFS was seen in those treated with&#13;&#10;paclitaxel/bevacizumab in comparison to weekly paclitaxel alone (median PFS 13.2 &#13;&#10;vs. 6.2months, p&lt;.01). There was a trend towards improved OS for&#13;&#10;paclitaxel/bevacizumab (median OS 20.6 vs. 9.1months; p=0.12). Toxicities were&#13;&#10;similar between the two regimens although more bowel perforations (2 vs. 0) were &#13;&#10;seen in the paclitaxel/bevacizumab group.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: A significant increase in PFS with a trend towards improved OS was&#13;&#10;demonstrated in this heavily pretreated population treated with&#13;&#10;paclitaxel/bevacizumab as compared to weekly paclitaxel alone. This data should&#13;&#10;be helpful in guiding future trials to determine the optimal care for women with &#13;&#10;recurrent EOC."/>
