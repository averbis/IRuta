Patients received topotecan 3.5?mg/m(2) intravenously on&#13;&#10;days -6 to -2, melphalan 70?mg/m(2) intravenously on days -3 and -2 and CY&#13;&#10;1?g/m(2) intravenously on days -6, -5 and -4. Overall response rate (ORR)&#13;&#10;consisting of complete response and partial response (CR+PR, PFS, OS and toxicity&#13;&#10;are reported. Between August 2002 to March 2004, 60 patients (34 men and 26&#13;&#10;women) with a median age of 61 years (range 45-72) were enrolled. Forty-one&#13;&#10;patients were treated for consolidation of first remission, while 19 patients had&#13;&#10;relapsed/refractory disease. ORR was 85% (CR 12%, very good PR 43% and PR 30%).&#13;&#10;Median time to neutrophil (ANC&gt;0.5 × 10(9)/L) and plt engraftment (&gt;20 × 10(9)/L)&#13;&#10;was 10 (range 7-12 days) and 9 days (range 6-79 days), respectively. A majority&#13;&#10;of the common adverse events were grade 1-3 mucositis/stomatitis (65%), grade 1&#13;&#10;or 2 nausea (59%) and grade 1 or 2 diarrhea (41%). Median PFS was 18.5 months and&#13;&#10;median OS has yet not been reached. In conclusion, topotecan, melphalan and CY is&#13;&#10;a safe and active conditioning regimen for auto hematopoietic SCT in MM. The ORR &#13;&#10;and PFS were comparable to high-dose melphalan."/>
