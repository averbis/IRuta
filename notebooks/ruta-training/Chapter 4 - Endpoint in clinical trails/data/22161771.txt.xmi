    <cas:Sofa xmi:id="6" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="Gefiinib and erlotinib are two similar small molecules of selective and&#13;&#10;reversible epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors&#13;&#10;(EGFR-TKIs), which have been approved for second-line or third-line indication in&#13;&#10;previously treated advanced Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The&#13;&#10;results of comparing the EGFR-TKI with standard platinum-based doublet&#13;&#10;chemotherapy as the first-line treatment in advanced NSCLC patients with&#13;&#10;activated EGFR mutation were still controversial. A meta-analysis was performed&#13;&#10;to derive a more precise estimation of these regimens. Finally, six eligible&#13;&#10;trials involved 1,021 patients were identified. The patients receiving EGFR-TKI&#13;&#10;as front-line therapy had a significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) &#13;&#10;than patients treated with chemotherapy [median PFS was 9.5 versus 5.9 months;&#13;&#10;hazard ratio (HR)=0.37; 95% confidence intervals (CI)=0.27-0.52; p&lt;0.001]. The&#13;&#10;overall response rate (ORR) of EGFR-TKI was 66.60%, whereas the ORR of&#13;&#10;chemotherapy regimen was 30.62%, which was also a statistically significant favor&#13;&#10;for EGFR-TKI [relative risk (RR)=5.68; 95% CI=3.17-10.18; p&lt;0.001]. The overall&#13;&#10;survival (OS) was numerically longer in the patients received EGFR-TKI than&#13;&#10;patients treated by chemotherapy, although the difference did not reach a&#13;&#10;statistical significance (median OS was 30.5 vs. 23.6 months; HR=0.94; 95%&#13;&#10;CI=0.77-1.15; p=0.57). Comparing with first-line chemotherapy, treatment of&#13;&#10;EGFR-TKI achieved a statistical significantly longer PFS, higher ORR and&#13;&#10;numerically longer OS in the advanced NSCLC patients harboring activated EGFR&#13;&#10;mutations, thus, it should be the first choice in the previously untreated NSCLC &#13;&#10;patients with activated EGFR mutation."/>
