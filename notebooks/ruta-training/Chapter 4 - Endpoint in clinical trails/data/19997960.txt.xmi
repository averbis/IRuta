The objectives were to evaluate overall response rate (ORR),&#13;&#10;progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety of cetuximab&#13;&#10;plus XELOX.&#13;&#10;METHODS: Previously untreated AGC patients received intravenous infusion of&#13;&#10;cetuximab 400 mg/m² on day 1 followed by weekly infusions of 250 mg/m².&#13;&#10;Oxaliplatin 130 mg/m² was administered intravenously on day 1 and capecitabine&#13;&#10;1,000 mg/m² bid was administered orally for 14 days of a 3-week cycle.&#13;&#10;Chemotherapy was given until disease progression or intolerable toxicities. On&#13;&#10;completing maximum 8 cycles of chemotherapy, patients were allowed weekly&#13;&#10;cetuximab until progression. Response evaluations were done every two cycles and &#13;&#10;toxicities were assessed at each visit.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Forty-four patients (29 male) were enrolled; median age was 57.5 years&#13;&#10;(range 36-70). In total, 253 cycles of XELOX chemotherapy (range 1-8, median 6.5 &#13;&#10;cycles) and 917 cetuximab infusions (range 1-58, median 19.0) were delivered.&#13;&#10;Overall RR was 52.3%. Median PFS and OS were 6.5 months (95% CI, 4.9-8.4) and&#13;&#10;11.8 months (95% CI, 6.7-16.8), respectively. The most common toxicities of all&#13;&#10;grades were anemia (81.8% of patients), asthenia (81.8%), anorexia (79.6%),&#13;&#10;hand-foot syndrome (79.6%), acneiform skin eruption (77.2%), and sensory&#13;&#10;neuropathy (75.0%), and they were mostly grade 1 or 2. Grade 3-4 hematologic&#13;&#10;toxicities were uncommon (anemia, 6.8%; thrombocytopenia, 2.3%).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: Cetuximab in combination with XELOX chemotherapy was active and safe&#13;&#10;as first-line treatment of metastatic and/or recurrent AGC patients."/>
