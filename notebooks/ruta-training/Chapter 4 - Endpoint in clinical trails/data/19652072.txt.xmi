Patients were randomly assigned to a sunitinib starting dose &#13;&#10;of 37.5 mg/d in the morning (AM) or evening (PM). RECIST-defined objective&#13;&#10;response rate (ORR) was the primary end point. Secondary end points included&#13;&#10;progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), adverse events (AEs), and&#13;&#10;quality-of-life measures.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: One hundred seven patients were randomly assigned to AM (n = 54) or PM&#13;&#10;(n = 53) dosing and on study for a median 8.3 months. Eighty-three patients&#13;&#10;discontinued, 65 due to disease progression and 16 because of AEs; two patients&#13;&#10;withdrew consent. Dosing was reduced to 25 mg/d in 46 patients (43%) due to grade&#13;&#10;3/4 AEs. The most common grade 3 treatment-related AEs were asthenia/fatigue&#13;&#10;(16%), diarrhea (11%), hypertension (11%), hand-foot syndrome (9%), and anorexia &#13;&#10;(8%). ORR was 20% with a 7.2-month median response duration. Median PFS and OS&#13;&#10;were 8.2 and 19.8 months, respectively, at median follow-up of 26.4 months.&#13;&#10;Efficacy, tolerability, and quality-of-life results were similar between patients&#13;&#10;dosed in the AM or PM.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: Sunitinib 37.5 mg, administered on a continuous once-daily dosing&#13;&#10;regimen, has a manageable safety profile as second-line mRCC therapy, providing&#13;&#10;flexible dosing, which can be explored in combination studies."/>
