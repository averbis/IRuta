The OPTIMOX1 study evaluated&#13;&#10;FOLFOX7, a simplified (s) leucovorin (LV) and 5-fluorouracil (5FU) regimen&#13;&#10;(sLV5FU2) with high-dose oxaliplatin, in a new oxaliplatin stop-and-go strategy. &#13;&#10;An exploratory cohort of patients aged 76 to 80 years was included in the study.&#13;&#10;METHODS: In all, 620 previously untreated patients were randomized between&#13;&#10;FOLFOX4 until progression (arm A), or FOLFOX7 for 6 cycles, maintenance without&#13;&#10;oxaliplatin for 12 cycles, and reintroduction of FOLFOX7 (arm B).&#13;&#10;RESULTS: A total of 37 patients aged 76 to 80 years were included, 20 in arm A&#13;&#10;and 17 in arm B. The overall response rate (ORR) was 59.4%, comparable to younger&#13;&#10;patients (59%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 9.0 months and median &#13;&#10;overall survival (OS) was 20.7 months. These results did not differ from that in &#13;&#10;younger patients &lt; or =75 years in the OPTIMOX1 study with PFS 9.0 months (P =&#13;&#10;.63) and OS 20.2 months (P = .57). They experienced slightly more grade 3 of 4&#13;&#10;toxicity than younger patients: 65% versus 48% (P = .06), mainly with more&#13;&#10;neutropenia (41% vs 24%, P = .03) and neurotoxicity (22% vs 11%, P = .06).&#13;&#10;Tolerability, however, was manageable and no toxic death occurred in this elderly&#13;&#10;population.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of FOLFOX-based treatment was maintained in patients&#13;&#10;&gt;75 years with both FOLFOX regimens. The oxaliplatin stop-and-go management&#13;&#10;strategy performed well in this population."/>
