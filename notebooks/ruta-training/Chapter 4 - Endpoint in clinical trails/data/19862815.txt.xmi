Primary endpoints included the&#13;&#10;objective response rate (ORR) and safety. Secondary endpoints included&#13;&#10;progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Exploratory endpoints &#13;&#10;included the predictive value of tumor tissue biomarkers.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Eighty patients were enrolled. The median follow-up was 19.7 months&#13;&#10;(range, 0-34.2 months). The ORR was 30% (95% confidence interval [CI],&#13;&#10;16.6%-46.5%) in the sorafenib arm and 25% (95% CI, 12.7%-41.2%) in the&#13;&#10;combination arm. The median PFS was 7.39 months in the sorafenib-alone arm (95%&#13;&#10;CI, 5.52-9.20 months) and 7.56 months in the sorafenib plus IFN arm (95% CI,&#13;&#10;5.19-11.07 months). The median OS was 27.04 months in the combination arm (95%&#13;&#10;CI, from 22.31 to not attained) and was not reached in the sorafenib arm.&#13;&#10;Toxicities were comparable in both arms. In a multivariate model, increased&#13;&#10;phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) levels were associated with poorer PFS&#13;&#10;(hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.00-1.08; P = .0411) and OS (hazard ratio, 1.15;&#13;&#10;95% CI, 1.02-1.29; P = .0173).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: The addition of low-dose IFN to sorafenib resulted in efficacy&#13;&#10;outcomes that were comparable to those achieved with sorafenib monotherapy. The&#13;&#10;current results indicated that pAKT levels may predict for clinical outcome, but &#13;&#10;further mechanistic study is required."/>
