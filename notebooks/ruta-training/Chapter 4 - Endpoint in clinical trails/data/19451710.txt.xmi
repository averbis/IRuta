The primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR) and secondary&#13;&#10;endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and&#13;&#10;toxicity.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were enrolled, and 45 were evaluable for response. &#13;&#10;A total of 320 cycles of chemotherapy were administered (median 6 cycles per&#13;&#10;patient). One complete response (2.1%) and 19 partial responses (39.6%) were&#13;&#10;noted, resulting in an ORR of 41.7% (95% confidence interval, CI: 27.7-55.6%) by &#13;&#10;intent-to-treat analysis. With a median follow-up duration of 22 months, the&#13;&#10;median PFS was 5.3 (95% CI: 2.8-7.8) months and the median OS was 13.6 (95% CI:&#13;&#10;9.3-17.9) months. There was 1 treatment-related death, and the most common grade &#13;&#10;3/4 toxicity was neutropenia (36.1%). Three patients discontinued treatment&#13;&#10;because of serum creatinine elevation.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: This study reaffirms the efficacy of oxaliplatin in advanced gastric &#13;&#10;cancer, but its dose of 100 mg/m(2) remains to be reconsidered in Korean&#13;&#10;patients."/>
