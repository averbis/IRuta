This study aimed to evaluate the&#13;&#10;efficacy and safety of NK105 in patients with advanced gastric cancer after&#13;&#10;failure of first-line chemotherapy.&#13;&#10;EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Eligible patients had measurable disease and one&#13;&#10;chemotherapeutic regimen except taxane. NK105 (150 mg PTX equivalent/m(2)) was&#13;&#10;administered by a 30-minute intravenous infusion every 3 weeks without&#13;&#10;anti-allergic premedication until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or&#13;&#10;patient refusal. The primary efficacy endpoint was best overall response rate&#13;&#10;(ORR) post baseline. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival&#13;&#10;(PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF) and overall survival (OS). All adverse&#13;&#10;events were reported using CTCAE v3.0.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Between November 2007 and July 2009, 57 patients were enrolled and 56&#13;&#10;were evaluable for efficacy. Two complete responses and 12 partial responses were&#13;&#10;observed for an ORR of 25%. The median PFS was 3.0 months, the median TTF was 2.8&#13;&#10;months, and the median OS was 14.4 months. Drug related toxicity was mainly mild &#13;&#10;(grades 1-2) to severe (grades 3-4); other data: neutropenia (64.9%); leukopenia &#13;&#10;(17.5%); lymphopenia (8.8%); neuropathy-sensory (1.8%); fatigue (3.5%); and&#13;&#10;stomatitis (1.8%). There were no treatment-related deaths.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: This study of NK105 (150 mg PTX equivalent/m(2)) proves the concept &#13;&#10;for the modest activity and tolerability of a new drug delivery system&#13;&#10;formulation for PTX. A phase III trial will be evaluated to clarify survival&#13;&#10;benefit."/>
