A one-arm, single-stage design was used to estimate the primary end &#13;&#10;point of objective response rate (ORR), defined by RECIST (Response Evaluation&#13;&#10;Criteria in Solid Tumors). Secondary end points included safety, duration of&#13;&#10;response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and&#13;&#10;patient-reported outcomes.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Of 62 patients recruited, 100% had received prior sorafenib, and 74.2%&#13;&#10;had received two or more prior systemic treatments. The axitinib dose was&#13;&#10;titrated to greater than 5 mg twice daily in 53.2% of patients, and 35.5% of&#13;&#10;patients had the dose modified to less than 5 mg twice daily. In 62 patients&#13;&#10;evaluable for response, the ORR was 22.6%, and the median duration of response&#13;&#10;was 17.5 months. Median PFS and OS times were 7.4 months (95% CI, 6.7 to 11.0&#13;&#10;months) and 13.6 months (95% CI, 8.4 to 18.8 months), respectively. All-causality&#13;&#10;grade 3 to 4 adverse events included hand-foot syndrome (16.1%), fatigue (16.1%),&#13;&#10;hypertension (16.1%), dyspnea (14.5%), diarrhea (14.5%), dehydration (8.1%), and &#13;&#10;hypotension (6.5%).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: Axitinib has antitumor activity in patients with mRCC refractory to&#13;&#10;prior VEGF-targeted therapy, including sorafenib. Toxicities were mild to&#13;&#10;moderate and were manageable. A randomized, phase III trial to compare axitinib&#13;&#10;with sorafenib in patients who have mRCC refractory to one prior first-line&#13;&#10;therapy regimen is underway."/>
