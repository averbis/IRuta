The primary end point was objective tumor response rate (ORR). &#13;&#10;Secondary end points included duration of stable disease (SD), progression-free&#13;&#10;survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), safety and pharmacokinetic profiles, and&#13;&#10;pharmacodynamic evaluations.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients received YM155. Two patients achieved a confirmed &#13;&#10;partial response, with an ORR of 5.4% (95% CI, 0.7% to 18.2%). An additional 14&#13;&#10;patients (37.8%) achieved SD resulting in a disease control rate of 43.2% (95%&#13;&#10;CI, 27.1% to 60.5%). Median duration of PFS was 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.3 to 2.8&#13;&#10;months). Median duration of OS was 6.6 months (95% CI, 4 to 12.2 months), with a &#13;&#10;1-year survival rate of 35.1%. Treatment with YM155 was well tolerated with the&#13;&#10;majority of treatment discontinuations not treatment related.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: YM155 exhibited modest single-agent activity in patients with&#13;&#10;refractory, advanced NSCLC. A favorable safety/tolerability profile was reported.&#13;&#10;Further evaluation of YM155 in combination with chemotherapy and other targeted&#13;&#10;agents may be warranted."/>
