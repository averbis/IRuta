The primary end point&#13;&#10;was the response rate. The secondary end points were progression-free and overall&#13;&#10;survival (PFS and OS), tumor marker response, and clinical benefit response&#13;&#10;(CBR).&#13;&#10;RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) on an intent-to-treat basis was 15% (95%&#13;&#10;confidence interval [95% CI], 4-26%). A positive CBR was obtained in 14 of 29&#13;&#10;(48%) patients. Seventeen of 25 (68%) patients had a reduction in carbohydrate&#13;&#10;antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) of &gt; 25%. The median time to treatment failure and the&#13;&#10;median PFS were 17 weeks (95% CI, 13-22 weeks) and 19 weeks (95% CI, 15-23&#13;&#10;weeks), respectively. The median OS was 40 weeks (95% CI, 36-45 weeks) and the&#13;&#10;1-year actuarial survival rate was 25.8%. Multivariate analysis showed that a&#13;&#10;performance status score of 0-1 at study entry and locally advanced disease were &#13;&#10;the only independent predictors of longer PFS and OS, whereas a reduction in CA&#13;&#10;19-9 serum levels &gt; 75% was an independent predictor of longer PFS, but had no&#13;&#10;impact on OS. Toxicity was mild with Grade 3-4 neutropenia (according to the&#13;&#10;National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria [version 2.0]) in 18 of 427&#13;&#10;treatment weeks (4.2%), and Grade 3 anemia and thrombocytopenia in 6 of 427&#13;&#10;treatment weeks (1.4%) and 9 of 427 treatment weeks (2.1%), respectively, and&#13;&#10;asymptomatic Grade 3-4 transaminase elevation in 21 of 427 treatment weeks&#13;&#10;(4.9%).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: FDR-gemcitabine at the weekly dose of 1000 mg/m(2) demonstrated&#13;&#10;promising activity, despite negligible toxicity, in patients with advanced-stage &#13;&#10;PDAC and BTC."/>
