We, prospectively, analyzed the toxicity and efficacy of the&#13;&#10;original FOLFOX4-regimen in the treatment of elderly patients affected by&#13;&#10;metastatic (m) colorectal cancer (CRC). Thirty-six consecutive patients aged&#13;&#10;67-82 years (median age 72 years), 22 males and 14 females, with mCRC and&#13;&#10;measurable disease, were enrolled in the study. The primary site of metastases&#13;&#10;was the liver (36.1% of patients). The median ECOG Performance Status (PS) was 1.&#13;&#10;The main hematological and extra-hematological (grade 3 or 4) toxicities were&#13;&#10;neutropenia (38.9%) and neurological (13.9%), respectively. A total of 36&#13;&#10;patients, aged 67-82 years were included. Twenty-two and 14 patients were male&#13;&#10;and female, respectively. The median age was 72 years (range 67-82). The primary &#13;&#10;site of metastases was the liver (36.1% of patients). The median ECOG Performance&#13;&#10;Status (PS) was 1. The overall response rate (ORR) was 44.4% and similar to&#13;&#10;original study. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.5 months and median &#13;&#10;overall survival (OS) was 16 months. The main hematological and&#13;&#10;extra-hematological (grade 3 or 4) toxicities were neutropenia (38.9%) and&#13;&#10;neurological (13.9%), respectively. Tolerability, however, was manageable and no &#13;&#10;toxic death occurred. FOLFOX4-regimen maintains its efficacy, and safety ratio in&#13;&#10;elderly patients with mCRC and good performance status. It would be considered&#13;&#10;the treatment of choice in the treatment of this particular setting of patients."/>
