This phase II study was conducted to confirm safety and activity of&#13;&#10;amrubicin in the treatment of refractory small-cell lung cancer (SCLC).&#13;&#10;PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with refractory SCLC (either with progressive&#13;&#10;disease as best response or progression within 90 days of first-line therapy)&#13;&#10;received amrubicin (40 mg/m(2)/d for 3 every 21 days). The primary end point was &#13;&#10;overall response rate (ORR); secondary end points included progression-free&#13;&#10;survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and change in left ventricular ejection&#13;&#10;fraction (LVEF).&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Seventy-five patients with a median progression-free interval after&#13;&#10;first-line therapy of 38 days were enrolled; 69 patients received a median of&#13;&#10;four amrubicin cycles (range, one to 12 cycles). The ORR was 21.3% (95% CI, 12.7%&#13;&#10;to 32.3%), with one complete response (1.3%) and 15 partial responses (20%).&#13;&#10;Median PFS and OS were 3.2 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.0 months) and 6.0 months (95%&#13;&#10;CI, 4.8 to 7.1 months), respectively. The ORR in 43 patients who never responded &#13;&#10;to first-line therapy was 16.3% (95% CI, 6.8% to 30.7%). Most commonly reported&#13;&#10;grade 3 or 4 adverse events included neutropenia (67%), thrombocytopenia (41%),&#13;&#10;and anemia (30%), with febrile neutropenia in 12%. There was no decrease in mean &#13;&#10;LVEF with cumulative amrubicin doses exceeding 750 mg/m(2).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: Single-agent amrubicin showed promising activity with a 21.3% ORR and&#13;&#10;an acceptable safety profile when used as second-line therapy patients with&#13;&#10;platinum-refractory SCLC. Amrubicin did not induce early cardiotoxicity, but its &#13;&#10;long-term effects are unknown."/>
