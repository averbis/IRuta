In this phase II study,we administered sagopilone to patients with&#13;&#10;breast cancer and brain metastases. We observed modest activity with a central&#13;&#10;nervous system objective response rate of 13.3%; however, median PFS was&#13;&#10;disappointing. Further studies should focus on other agents to treat this&#13;&#10;challenging clinical problem.BACKGROUND: Patients with progressive metastatic&#13;&#10;breast cancer to the central nervous system (CNS) have limited treatment options.&#13;&#10;PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a phase II study of sagopilone, an epothilone &#13;&#10;B analogue that crosses the blood-brain barrier, in patients with breast cancer&#13;&#10;brain metastases. Women were treated with 16 mg/m(2) or 22 mg/m(2) intravenously &#13;&#10;every 21 days. The primary endpoint was CNS objective response rate (ORR).&#13;&#10;Secondary endpoints included toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS), and&#13;&#10;overall survival (OS). Using modified, high-resolution magnetic resonance&#13;&#10;angiography (MRA), we also evaluated changes in vessel tortuosity with treatment.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Fifteen women were enrolled; all had progressive CNS disease despite&#13;&#10;whole-brain radiotherapy. Two patients achieved a partial response (ORR, 13.3%)&#13;&#10;and remained in the study for 6 cycles. Responses were not associated with&#13;&#10;normalization of tumor-associated vessels on correlative imaging studies. Median &#13;&#10;PFS and OS were 1.4 months and 5.3 months, respectively. The most common grade 3 &#13;&#10;toxicities were lymphopenia and fatigue. Enrollment was stopped prematurely&#13;&#10;because of limited observed activity and slow accrual.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSIONS: Sagopilone was associated with modest CNS activity in patients with &#13;&#10;breast cancer; however median PFS was disappointing. Further studies should&#13;&#10;examine other potentially active agents and/or combinations for this challenging &#13;&#10;clinical problem."/>
