A phase II study was conducted to&#13;&#10;evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin combined with docetaxel for&#13;&#10;NSCLC.&#13;&#10;METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB or IV, chemotherapy-naive NSCLC received&#13;&#10;docetaxel 70 mg/m(2), oxaliplatin 130 mg/m(2), and pegfilgrastim 6 mg every 21&#13;&#10;days for up to six cycles. Primary endpoint was overall response rate (ORR),&#13;&#10;secondary endpoints were progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and&#13;&#10;safety.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were treated; 93% had stage IV disease and 28% had &#13;&#10;brain metastases. In 27 evaluable patients with follow-up, there were 10 partial &#13;&#10;responses for an ORR of 37% (90% confidence interval [CI], 22-55%). Median PFS&#13;&#10;was 4.6 months (95% CI, 2.6-6.5 months); 12-month PFS was 14.8% (95% CI,&#13;&#10;3.4-34.0%). Median OS was 10.9 months (95% CI, 8.9-16.8 months); 12-month OS was &#13;&#10;40% (95% CI, 19-61%) and 18-month OS was 16% (95% CI, 1-46%). In 29 treated&#13;&#10;patients, there were no unusual or unexpected adverse events. The most common&#13;&#10;grade 3 and 4 toxicities were anemia (14% of patients) and hyperglycemia (10%);&#13;&#10;there were only two reports of neutropenia; both were grade 1 or 2.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: These phase II findings suggest that the combination of oxaliplatin&#13;&#10;and docetaxel is active and well tolerated, and should be further investigated as&#13;&#10;a feasible treatment alternative for patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC."/>
