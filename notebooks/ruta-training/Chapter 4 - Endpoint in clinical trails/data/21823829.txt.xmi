    <cas:Sofa xmi:id="6" sofaNum="1" sofaID="_InitialView" mimeType="text" sofaString="We performed a phase II study of oral vorinostat (200 mg twice daily, days 1-14&#13;&#10;of a 21-day cycle), a histone and protein deacetylase inhibitor, to examine&#13;&#10;efficacy and tolerability in patients with relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma&#13;&#10;(HL) with = 5 prior therapies. The primary endpoint was the objective response&#13;&#10;rate (ORR), with secondary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS), overall &#13;&#10;survival (OS), safety and tolerability. A two-stage design was used for patient&#13;&#10;accrual. Twenty-five eligible patients were accrued in the first stage. Median&#13;&#10;time on treatment was 3.8 months. The ORR was 4% (one partial response). Median&#13;&#10;PFS was 4.8 months. The drug was well tolerated. The second stage of accrual was &#13;&#10;not opened due to few objective responses. Oral vorinostat has limited&#13;&#10;single-agent activity in relapsed/refractory HL. There was one partial response, &#13;&#10;while seven other patients had stable disease for &gt; 1 year, including two with&#13;&#10;stable disease for nearly 3 years, suggesting that further studies in combination&#13;&#10;with other active agents in this setting may be warranted."/>
