Preplanned analyses of tumour biomarkers on&#13;&#10;treatment outcome were performed.&#13;&#10;PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received sunitinib 50mg/day for 4 weeks with 2&#13;&#10;weeks rest until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary&#13;&#10;end-point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end-points included&#13;&#10;progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled and treated (safety population, SP). In&#13;&#10;the intention to treat population (n=51); the ORR was 3.9%, median PFS was 1.28&#13;&#10;months [95% CI, 1.18-1.90], median OS was 5.81 months [95% CI, 3.48-12.32], the&#13;&#10;estimated one-year survival rate was 23.7% [95%CI: 12.8-36.5]. In subgroup&#13;&#10;analyses, tumour VEGF-C expression compared with no expression was associated&#13;&#10;with significantly shorter median PFS (1.23 versus 2.86 months, logrank p=0.0119)&#13;&#10;but there was no difference in tumour control rate (p=0.142). In the SP, serious &#13;&#10;adverse events occurred in 26 patients, leading to 13 deaths, all sunitinib&#13;&#10;unrelated. Thirty-eight patients died from progressive disease, nine died &lt;60&#13;&#10;days after treatment start.&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: Sunitinib monotherapy was associated with limited tumour response and&#13;&#10;good/moderate tolerability in this setting."/>
