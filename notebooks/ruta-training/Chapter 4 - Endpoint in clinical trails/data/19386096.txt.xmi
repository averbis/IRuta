Secondary end points were progression-free survival (PFS),&#13;&#10;overall survival (OS) and safety.&#13;&#10;RESULTS: Altogether 87 patients were enrolled (41 pts in the XELIRI and 46 pts in&#13;&#10;the FOLFIRI arm). The median age was 63 years (63 years in the XELIRI and 62&#13;&#10;years in the FOLFIRI arm) (p = 0.33). ORR was 49% in the XELIRI and 48% in the&#13;&#10;FOLFIRI arm (p = 0.76). The rate of radical R0 resection was 24% in both arms of &#13;&#10;patients. At the end of treatment, 37% of patients in the XELIRI and 26% of&#13;&#10;patients in the FOLFIRI arm were without evidence of the disease (CR+R0&#13;&#10;resection) (p = 0.56). There were no statistical differences in grade 3 or 4&#13;&#10;adverse events between both arms: diarrhoea 7% vs. 6%, neutropenia 5% vs. 13%,&#13;&#10;ischemic stroke 0 vs. 2%, acute coronary syndrome 2% vs. 4%, respectively. At the&#13;&#10;median follow up of 17 (range 1-39) months, the median PFS was 10.3 months in the&#13;&#10;XELIRI and 9.3 months in the FOLFIRI arm (p = 0.78), the median OS was 30.7&#13;&#10;months in the XELIRI arm and 16.6 months in the FOLFIRI arm (p = 0.16).&#13;&#10;CONCLUSION: The XELIRI regimen showed similar ORR as the FOLFIRI regimen in the&#13;&#10;neoadjuvant treatment of patients with MCRC. In addition, the XELIRI regimen&#13;&#10;showed similar PFS and OS with acceptable toxicity compared to the FOLFIRI&#13;&#10;regimen.&#13;&#10;TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN19912492."/>
