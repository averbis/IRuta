PURPOSE: This phase II study evaluated the safety and efficacy of single-agent
amrubicin versus topotecan in patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)
sensitive to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to amrubicin (40
mg/m(2)/d in a 5-minute intravenous [IV] infusion, days 1 through 3, every 21
days) or topotecan (1.5 mg/m(2)/d in a 30-minute IV infusion, days 1 through 5,
every 21 days). The primary efficacy end point was overall response rate (ORR)
for amrubicin. Secondary end points included time to progression, median
progression-free survival (PFS), and median overall survival (OS).
RESULTS: Of 76 patients enrolled, 50 patients were randomly assigned to
amrubicin, and 26 patients were randomly assigned to topotecan. Amrubicin
treatment resulted in a significantly higher ORR than topotecan (44% v 15%; P =
.021). Median PFS and median OS were 4.5 months and 9.2 months with amrubicin and
3.3 months and 7.6 months with topotecan, respectively. Tolerability was similar 
with both agents. However, grade 3 or worse neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
seemed to be more frequent in the topotecan group as compared with the amrubicin 
group (78% and 61% v 61% and 39%, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Amrubicin shows promising activity, with an ORR of 44% compared with 
an ORR of 15% for topotecan as second-line treatment in patients with SCLC
sensitive to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. In addition, the safety
profiles were comparable; however, a trend was noted for more frequent grade 3 or
worse neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in the topotecan group as compared with
the amrubicin group. Additional studies are ongoing.
