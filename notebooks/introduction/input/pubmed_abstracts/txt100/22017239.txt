BACKGROUND: Patients with upper gastrointestinal cancers have a poor prognosis
and only few treatment options. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are valid targets in many solid
tumours, and they have synergistic effects in preclinical studies.
METHODS: In this multi-center phase II trial patients with chemoresistant,
metastatic upper gastrointestinal cancer were treated with erlotinib (150 mg
daily) and bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every two weeks). Primary endpoint was overall
response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints were progression free survival (PFS),
overall survival (OS), toxicity and biomarker correlates. Plasma samples were
analysed for EGFR and angiogenesis related markers using quantitative
immunoassays.
RESULTS: One hundred and two patients were enrolled in the trial between June
2006 and October 2007. The most common toxicities were skin reaction, diarrhoea, 
and fatigue. ORR was 6%, median PFS was 2.2 months, and OS 4.3 months. Low
concentration of urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) domain I was
correlated to longer PFS and OS.
DISCUSSION: The combination of erlotinib and bevacizumab is well tolerated,
however, with low clinical activity in patients with chemoresistant UGI cancer.
Some patients do benefit from the therapy, and uPAR forms are potential
biomarkers in these patients.
