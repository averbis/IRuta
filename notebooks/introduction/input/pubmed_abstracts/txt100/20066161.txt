Although leiomyosarcomas (LMSs) form the largest subgroup of soft tissue sarcomas
(STSs), the efficacy of chemotherapy in this group is largely unclear, partly
because older studies are contaminated with gastrointestinal stromal tumors
(GISTs). In this retrospective study we investigated the outcome of first line
chemotherapy in 65 patients with unresectable or metastatic LMS. The overall
response rate (ORR) was 18%; and the median progression-free (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) were 3.8 and 9.7 months respectively. No statistically significant 
differences in outcomes for uterine and non-uterine LMS were found. In
non-uterine LMS, however, the PFS and OS seemed to be longer for females than for
males, potentially negatively affecting outcomes in this group. If our
observations are confirmed in other series, they would suggest that studies
performed in STS patients should not only stratify for histological subtype but
also for uterine versus non-uterine LMS and for gender.
