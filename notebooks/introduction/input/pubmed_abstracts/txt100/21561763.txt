BACKGROUND: Sunitinib monotherapy in pretreated patients with advanced gastric
cancer (AGC) was investigated. Preplanned analyses of tumour biomarkers on
treatment outcome were performed.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients received sunitinib 50mg/day for 4 weeks with 2
weeks rest until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary
end-point was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary end-points included
progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and safety.
RESULTS: Fifty-two patients were enrolled and treated (safety population, SP). In
the intention to treat population (n=51); the ORR was 3.9%, median PFS was 1.28
months [95% CI, 1.18-1.90], median OS was 5.81 months [95% CI, 3.48-12.32], the
estimated one-year survival rate was 23.7% [95%CI: 12.8-36.5]. In subgroup
analyses, tumour VEGF-C expression compared with no expression was associated
with significantly shorter median PFS (1.23 versus 2.86 months, logrank p=0.0119)
but there was no difference in tumour control rate (p=0.142). In the SP, serious 
adverse events occurred in 26 patients, leading to 13 deaths, all sunitinib
unrelated. Thirty-eight patients died from progressive disease, nine died <60
days after treatment start.
CONCLUSION: Sunitinib monotherapy was associated with limited tumour response and
good/moderate tolerability in this setting.
