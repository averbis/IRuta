OBJECTIVE: To determine efficacy, toxicity, and survival in patients with
recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) receiving combination of weekly
paclitaxel and biweekly bevacizumab (PB).
METHODS: We reviewed chemotherapy logs identifying all patients receiving
combination PB. Toxicities were graded using CTCAEv3.0 criteria. Response rates
(RR) were measured using RECIST criteria or by CA-125 levels per modified Rustin 
criteria. RR and progression-free survival (PFS) were determined and plotted
using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.
RESULTS: Fifty-one patients receiving at least two cycles of chemotherapy were
evaluable for survival and 55 patients receiving one cycle of PB were evaluable
in toxicity analysis. The mean number of previous regimens was four. The overall 
median PFS was 7 months and median OS was 12 months. The overall response rate
(ORR) was 60% (CR 25% and PR 35%). Median PFS for complete and partial responders
were 14 and 5 months respectively. Stable disease was seen in 26% with median PFS
of 6 months. Thirteen experienced treatment delays for a variety of factors. The 
most G3/4 toxicities were fatigue (16%), hematologic (9%) and neurotoxicity (7%).
Three patients (5%) experienced bowel perforations.
CONCLUSIONS: Combination of paclitaxel and bevacizumab is feasible and
demonstrates an acceptable toxicity profile and a high response rate. These
observations should be useful in planning future clinical trials with this
combination therapy.
