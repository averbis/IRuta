A phase II clinical trial was performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
gefitinib on pretreated Chinese female non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients. Chinese female patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who
failed at least one platinum-based chemotherapy received gefitinib monotherapy
(250 mg/day) between April 2002 and January 2010. The primary endpoint was
overall response rate (ORR), and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS)
and progression-free survival (PFS). Of the 40 evaluable female patients, the ORR
was 62.5%. All patients have responded with one (2.5%) complete response, 24
(60%) partial response, 12 (30%) stable disease, and 3 (7.5%) progressive
disease. The OS and PFS were 20 months (95% CI: 11.9-28 months) and 13 months
(95% CI: 8.0-17.9 months), respectively. Survival (OS and PFS) were longer in
patients with good performance status and in patients older than 65 years (P <
0.05). The most frequently observed toxicities were rash/dry skin (80%), diarrhea
(42.5%), and vomiting/anorexia (32.5%). Four patients developed grade 3
toxicities (rash and diarrhea) but did not require either dose reduction or
discontinuation. Gefitinib is a highly effective and well-tolerated agent for
Chinese women with pretreated advanced NSCLC.
