BACKGROUND: Src inhibitors sensitise melanoma cells to chemotherapy in
preclinical models. The combination of dasatinib and dacarbazine was tested in a 
phase I trial in melanoma.
METHODS: Patients had ECOG performance status 0-2 and normal organ function.
Dacarbazine was administered on day 1 and dasatinib on day 2 through 19 of each
21-day cycle. Both were escalated from 50 mg b.i.d. of dasatinib and 800 mg m(-2)
of dacarbazine. Available pre-treatment biopsies were sequenced for BRAF, NRAS,
and C-Kit mutations.
RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity was reached at dasatinib 70 mg b.i.d./dacarbazine
1000 mg m(-2), and was predominantly haematological. In 29 patients receiving
dasatinib 70 mg b.i.d., the objective response rate (ORR) was 13.8%, the clinical
benefit rate (ORR+SD) was 72.4%, the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) was 
20.7%, and the 12-month overall survival (OS) was 34.5%. Two out of three
patients who were wild type for BRAF, NRAS, and c-KIT mutations had confirmed
partial responses, and one had a minor response.
CONCLUSION: The recommended phase II dose is dasatinib 70 mg b.i.d with
dacarbazine 800 mg m(-2). PFS and OS data for dasatinib at 70 mg b.i.d. with
dacarbazine compared favourably with historical controls. Preliminary data
support evaluating tumour mutation status further as a biomarker of response.
