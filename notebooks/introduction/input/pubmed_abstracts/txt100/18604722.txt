Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma (PMLCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin
lymphoma with distinct clinical and gene expression profiles. Outcomes of salvage
chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for relapsed or
refractory disease (RR) have not been well characterised. We retrospectively
identified 180 consecutive RR patients (37 PMLCL and a control group of 143
DLBCL) that underwent salvage chemotherapy. The overall response rate (ORR) to
salvage chemotherapy (25% vs. 48%, p = 0.01) and 2-year OS after diagnosis of RR 
disease (15% vs. 34%, p = 0.018) was inferior in PMLCL patients. The 2-year
post-ASCT OS (67% PMLCL vs. 53%, p = 0.78) and PFS (57% PMLCL vs. 36%, p = 0.64) 
were similar. RR PMLCL had an inferior ORR and survival compared with DLBCL but
chemosensitive PMLCL and DLBCL patients have similar outcomes post-ASCT.
Strategies for PMLCL should focus on identifying poor risk patients to test novel
induction and salvage strategies.
