The life-expectancy of women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is closely
linked to response to therapy. A significant increase in progression-free
survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) has been demonstrated in women who
achieve a complete response. Anthracycline combinations have been proven as
highly effective in MBC, and anthracycline regimens plus cyclophosphamide with or
without fluorouracil were established as first-line chemotherapy for MBC in the
1990s. Clinical trials have shown that anthracycline-taxane combinations are more
effective than anthracyclines or taxanes alone in terms of overall response rates
(ORR), PFS and OS in women who have not received prior anthracycline
chemotherapy. The use of anthracycline-based regimens is limited, however, by the
widespread use of anthracycline adjuvant therapy and the development of
anthracycline-resistance. Platinum-taxane combinations have similar efficacy to
anthracycline-based regimens and are well-tolerated by patients. Carboplatin
combined with paclitaxel or docetaxel is more effective than carboplatin or
taxanes alone, with ORR of 53-62%. Taxane combinations with gemcitabine or
capecitabine are also more effective than docetaxel, paclitaxel, capecitabine or 
gemcitabine administered alone. The efficacy of docetaxel and paclitaxel can be
increased, and drug-related toxicity decreased, by adapting dose-dense schedules 
of drug administration. The addition of trastuzumab to taxane-based chemotherapy 
increases the efficacy of taxane-based regimens in women with HER2-positive MBC.
