OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and safety of goserelin plus anastrozole
in advanced premenopausal breast cancer patients.
METHODS: We summarized a single-centre experience with goserelin plus anastrozole
in 32 premenopausal women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC). All patients
received goserelin 3.6 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks concurrently
with anastrozole 1 mg daily. The median duration of treatment was 12 months.
RESULTS: No patient achieved complete remission (CR) (0%), 6 partial remissions
(PR) (18.8%), 21 stable diseases (SD) (65.6%) and 5 progressive diseases (PD)
(15.6%). Objective response rate (ORR) was achieved in 18.8% and clinical benefit
(CR + PR + SD > 6 months) in 68.8%. The median progression-free survival (PFS)
was 12 (2 - 57) months. One-year overall survival rate (OS) was 87.4% and
two-year OS 66.9%. The OS of patients without visceral metastasis was
significantly longer than that of patients with visceral metastasis (P = 0.04).
Hot flushes and nausea were predominant toxicities.
CONCLUSION: The combination of goserelin and anastrozole appears to be an
efficient and well-tolerated regimen in premenopausal MBC women.
