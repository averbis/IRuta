BACKGROUND: Combination of capecitabine and irinotecan (XELIRI regimen) is an
active and well tolerated treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The 
aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this regimen in
combination with bevacizumab (BV), as first-line treatment for mCRC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 46 consecutive patients received a combination
of BV (5?mg?kg?¹, day 1), irinotecan (175?mg?m?², day 1) and capecitabine
(1000?mg?m?² twice daily on day 2-8), every 2 weeks. Patients were treated until 
disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary objective was to
determine the progression-free survival (PFS) and safety profile.
RESULTS: The overall response rate (ORR) was 67.4%, with a disease control rate
(ORR+stable disease) of 93.5%. Median PFS and overall survival (OS) were 12.3
months (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.5-18.1 months) and 23.7 months (95% CI:
16.7-30.6 months), respectively. The most frequent grade 3/4 treatment-related
adverse events were asthenia (7%), diarrhoea (7%), nausea (9%) and vomiting (7%).
CONCLUSION: Bevacizumab combined with biweekly XELIRI is a highly active
first-line regimen for mCRC treatment, showing encouraging PFS, ORR and OS with a
good tolerability.
