# Introduction to IRuta Notebooks

The notebooks in this directory explain how IRuta notebooks are functioning. IRuta is a Ruta kernel with various so-called magic commands that are used to communicate with the kernel. In these notebooks, there is a special emphasis on explaining these magic commands. There are also examples how Ruta and Python can be integrated within the same notebook. 

The target audience of these notebooks are **developers who already have a basic understanding of Ruta**. If you are new to UIMA Ruta, then we recommend starting with the Notebooks in the [ruta-tutorial](../ruta-tutorial/) directory. They will explain the basic Ruta language concepts in an interactive and guided fashion.
